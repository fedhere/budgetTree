**Federal Budget visualizations**

These are federal budget visualizations prepared for Mike Holland's [NYU CUSP](http://cusp.nyu.edu/) lecture on the inner works of the US federal budget committees.

The visualizations are root trees in the style of the famous [http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/newsgraphics/2011/0119-budget](NY Times 2012 visualization by Shan Carter and Amanda Cox).
Visualizations are made for the 2012 budget compared to the 2010 and the 2017 budget compared to the 2016. 
In each visuzlization the size of the money allocated for a department/agency/program is represented as the size of the corresponding box. 
Funds are aggregated wither by Account or by superfunction (what is a super function?? that is for Mike to explain!).
One last set of visualizations has the mandatory budget grayed out, so one can focus on the discretionary budget decisions. 

All plots are aggregates in [this](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/~fb55/budgetTree/) webpage.

The visualizations are created in D3, the code that parses the original budget excell spreadsheet to prepare json files for the visualization is in [budgetParser.ipynb](budgetParser.ipynb).
